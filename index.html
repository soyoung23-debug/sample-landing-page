        <p1>Hi! I'm John Doe</p1>
        <p2>For as long as I can remember, I've seen the world through a lens. My journey into photography began with a simple desire to freeze moments in timeâ€”the fleeting smile, the genuine laugh, the quiet beauty of a landscape at dawn. What started as a hobby quickly became my life's passion. My goal is to create images that aren't just photos, but memories you can feel. Let's tell your story together, one frame at a time.</p2>
